## What is this, even?

Hey, hi! I’m Uly and this document, like me, is a work in progress. It exists to provide you a clear way to understand how we can make the most of our work relation. 

## What the heck I do here?

It’s very important to understand what the company expects from me and what I expect from you. At the most basic level, my role is to keep teams happy and productive, delivering great products on time and with quality. I really care about the health, performance, stability of the teams and our applications, and I’ll do everything I can to keep everybody energised and with all the necessary tools to do a great job.

If I do something that negatively impacts my ability to retain you, you would be doing me a huge favor if you let me know about it, as soon as possible. If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job than setting context, you'd be doing me a huge favor if you let me know about it, as soon as possible.

Some bullets to illustrate:

* I'm here to make sure you are both successful and happy: I want you to improve your technical skills, grow your career, enjoy your work, and believe in both our team's and our company's mission.
* I'm here to make sure our team is getting what we need from other teams, and that other teams are getting what they need from us; I'm also here to help make sure we are working on the right things, which is not necessarily everything we're asked to do.
* I’m here to help and support you, to set context for what you’re working on, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company.
* I do a bunch of things here, very few of them are more important than spending time talking with you if you want to talk with me. Feel entirely free to put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want. 

## What do I value most?

We are currently working on culture / engineering culture at 4all, but we don’t have any public material yet. But I can give you some spoilers. Mostly of what I value is based on some specific points of it:

* We need each other to make a great impact and I really expect from you some resilience and proactivity to solve our challenges. Sorry for the cliché, but it is what it is.
* It would be great if you feel comfortable to have initiative. Our evolution as a company can’t stop and you are a very important piece on this journey.
* Be collaborative, as our CEO says "it’s impossible to create something great by yourself". Connect with people, we have incredible human beings here at 4all, so, take some advantage from it.
* Share your failures, nobody is going to judge you. We have a safe environment to test things, don’t be afraid to teach us something that doesn’t work, you’ll be helping the company to not repeat mistakes.
* For God’s sake, be open minded. It doesn’t need to be hard to shift opinions. Embrace the impermanence of life.
* This one is special for me: be a positive influence in your team, it’s better for your mental health and for the company. You are going to feel better once you see yourself as an agent of the change than a complainer.
* I value transparency about what’s happened, what’s happening, and what’s going to happen.

## 1:1

At least once a month we’ll have moments to talk about some subjects which matter to you and me. 1-1s are very important to me because they are dedicated spaces for you to talk about anything and everything you want, they are meetings primarily for you, and only secondarily for me, It’s not a status meeting, unless you want to talk about status, 1-1s are flexible -- they can shift and change to fit around our shifting schedules. And oh, don’t save urgent matters for a 1-1. 

More than any other factor, candid and compassionate feedback is central to a cohesive high-functioning team. Feedback is best received in the context of psychological safety; I want you to know, both intellectually and experientially, that my primary desire is for you to be happy and fulfilled. 

I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.

## Things you should know about me

* I love to work with technology and management and hacking and product and writing and mental models ad infinitum. I’m curious about several subjects. 
* When I’m not in operating mode I’m always reading: "That's how knowledge works: It builds up, like compound interest”.
* I get VERY happy when people around me suggest things to improve something in our teams/company/apps/apis/etc.
* I get REALLY upset with complaints without suggestions/actions. For real.
* On a regular day, I'm at the office from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM, after that I'm reachable only via whatsapp/slack.
